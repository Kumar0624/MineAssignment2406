1. import { test as baseTest } from '@playwright/test';

    test is test runner which is basically create a particular enviournment for you to run your test execution which can control our test flow 
    Imports test from Playwright’s test library. 
    test as baseTest means:
        Rename test to baseTest.
        This avoids confusion when creating a custom test later.
    👉 Meaning:
    We are importing Playwright’s default test and renaming it for extension.


2. export const test = baseTest.extend({ 

    Creates a new custom test by extending Playwright’s base test.
    extend() allows you to add or override fixtures.
    export makes this custom test available to other test files.
    👉 Meaning:
    We are creating our own test setup on top of Playwright’s test.


3. page: async ({ page }, use) => {

    This is a fixture override.
    page → existing Playwright fixture.
    ({ page }) → destructuring to extract the page object.
    use → callback that tells Playwright when the test can run.
    👉 Meaning:
    We are customizing how the page fixture behaves.


4. await use(page);

    Hands control back to Playwright.
    Executes the actual test code.
    Ensures this page is used in the test lifecycle.
    👉 Meaning:
    “Setup is done, now run the test with this page.”
