// Hoisting Example
// Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.
// it define behaviour of each & every variable and function declaration this process is known as hoisting.
var x 

//console.log(x);

var x = 5;
//console.log(x);

x = 10;
console.log(x);
// Here, the declaration of 'x' is hoisted to the top, but its assignment happens in place.
